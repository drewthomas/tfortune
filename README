NAME
       tfortune - fortune with recursive directory traversal
SYNOPSIS
       tfortune [-c] [-e] [-f] [-w] [path]...
DESCRIPTION
       tfortune  samples  a  random  fortune cookie (or other snippet of text)
       from text files in fortune(6) format, and writes it to standard output.
       tfortune is a partial reimplementation of fortune(6) that adds the fea‐
       ture of recursive directory traversal; tfortune scours an entire direc‐
       tory hierarchy for text files from which to sample. The user may speci‐
       fy an alternative directory hierarchy to search by giving its  path  as
       an argument.
LIMITATIONS
       Where it implements features of fortune(6), tfortune tries to mimic its
       behaviour if that's sensible, but there are some differences, and  most
       options (-a, -i, -l, -m, -n, -o, -s and -u) are simply unimplemented.
